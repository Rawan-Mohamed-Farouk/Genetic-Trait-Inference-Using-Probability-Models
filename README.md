# Project Title
Genetic Trait Inference Using Probability Models

## Description
This project involves developing a probabilistic model to infer genetic traits from family data. By using conditional probabilities and Bayesian inference, the program calculates the likelihood of individuals having certain genes and traits based on their parents' genetic information and given probabilities for gene mutations. The project includes functions to load data, compute joint probabilities, update probabilities, and normalize the results to ensure they sum to one. This model helps in understanding the inheritance patterns and predicting the traits in a given family.

## What I Learned
- **Bayesian Inference:**
  - Gained an understanding of Bayesian inference and how to apply it to probabilistic models.
- **Probability Theory:**
  - Enhanced knowledge of probability theory, including conditional probabilities and joint probabilities.
- **Data Manipulation:**
  - Improved skills in data manipulation and parsing CSV files to extract and process relevant information.
- **Algorithm Design:**
  - Learned to design and implement algorithms for calculating complex probabilities and normalizing distributions.
- **Python Programming:**
  - Strengthened Python programming skills, particularly in using libraries such as csv and itertools.
- **Debugging and Testing:**
  - Developed debugging techniques and learned to test probabilistic models to ensure accuracy.
